I am a Ph.D. candidate at Wuhan University, where I focus on research at the intersection of computer vision and remote sensing. My work primarily involves building texture synthesis and generation, semantic segmentation, and style transfer. I am particularly interested in using generative models—such as diffusion models and neural style transfer frameworks—to enhance the realism and consistency of 2D and 3D representations of urban environments.
My research also explores multi-source data integration and the development of automated pipelines for large-scale 3D reconstruction, with applications in digital city modeling, urban planning, and historical scene restoration.
